<p>Learning how to develop a score using abjad remains one of the more
challenging aspects for new users. While it is possible to generate
some interesting music fragments using abjad through an interactive
prompt, and possible to create full scores from a concise single script,
it’s not at all obvious how one might go about structuring a larger project
that allows for the structuring of musical information into a score and parts.</p>
<p>What this page aims to do:
+ provide a simple, high-level description of a score structure
+ offer some very basic guidance on what each subdirectory could contain
+ recommend a few useful learning resources</p>
<p>What this page does not aim to do:
+ give a step by step tutorial on creating scores with abjad
+ give detailed description of class functionality within the
+ explain the details of python packaging</p>

<h1>Persistence, Modules and Packages<a class="headerlink" href="#persistence-modules-and-packages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>In many of the examples contained in the abjad documentation the interactive prompt
is used to generate short musical fragments to briefly demonstrate some feature.
The process of working with scores is by nature quite different, it is by nature
based around iteration and incremental improvement rather than simply “finding
the right formula”. So how do iteration and incremental improvement work in terms
of abjad? Well, basically abjad is excellent and generating lilypond code and one
of the main ways that persistence is handled is in the form of lilypond source files.
The generation of such files will be covered in more detail in the section on segments.</p>
<p>Chapter 5 of Josiah Wolf Oberholzer’s 2015 dissertation is titled “Composition as software development”
and contains a much more detailed look at some of the same information contained in this document.
Specifically, he provides some detailed examples of how he has structured the contents of a score
package in relation to his own compositional work. Also, he emphasizes the use of python modules
and packages. A thorough understanding of both modules and</p>
<p>In order to understand the basic building blocks of a score and how they fit together,
it is necessary to understand how python modules and packages work. For a good description
of how</p>

<h1>Creativity<a class="headerlink" href="#creativity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>An important thing to remember when working with software design is that a well written
program creates a very accurate model of a set of ideas. In essence, this is similar to
what a well written score does, it provides a clear, abstract representation of a composition,
which itself is simply a collection of musical ideas.</p>
<p>While it is beneficial to spend time studying source code listings of existing score examples
and reverse engineering them in order to figure out how they work, it is probably much more
beneficial to spend time imagining the type of musical ideas that you want to represent
with a score.</p>
